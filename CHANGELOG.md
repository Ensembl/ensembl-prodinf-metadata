CHANGELOG - Ensembl Metadata: Ensembl Production Service
=========================================

v1.0.0
------
- New repository split off from initial monolithic [application](https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-prodinf-legacy-srv)
- Flask endpoints preserved, but files/directories rearranged to be consistent across all Ensembl Production services
- Changed namespace to `ensembl.production.metadata`
